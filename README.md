# Intrinsic-Value-Calculator
An intrinsic value calculator Android App for stocks built using Android Studio. 

The intrinsic value of a stock is defined here as the amount of money that is generated over the lifetime of a business, related to the current book value. This is calculated by a summation of the dividends received and the annual compound change in book value over the next 10 years. The value obtained is discounted using the 10 year US Treasury Note (the discount rate) to obtain a value in today's money.
